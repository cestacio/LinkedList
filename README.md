### How to Run Locally
fork this repository: https://github.com/cestacio/LinkedList

2. In a new tab, `mongod` (unless it's already running)
3. `nodemon server.js` 

Sever runs on http://localhost:3000 by default. 

You can also pass any enviornment variables in a `.env` file. 

### Notes on Data Model

We have three main resources: **User**, **Company**, and **Job**. 

1. `Company` can have many jobs.

Company `jobs` exist as arrays of [Mongoose reds which are populated](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/populate.html) in the retrieval methods.

2. `Job` can only have one company. 

The routing is based on `username`'s which are user-generated, `handle`'s which are company-generated, and `jobId`'s which are generated by the job posting. 

3. `User`'s `currentCompanyId` and `companyId` in experience are referenced to the company IF it exists.
